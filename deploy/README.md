# Deploy

Deployment is split into one shared Compose file plus one environment-specific
override.

## Assumptions

- Commands are run from `evaluation-protocol/deploy`
- Docker Engine and the Docker Compose plugin are installed
- Repo-root `.env.example` exists
- Server deployment uses sibling `root-proxy`
- Local deployment runs directly on `localhost`

## First-Time Setup

```bash
cd ~/evaluation-protocol/deploy && sh deploy.sh
```

Expected result: setup completes and prints a message. Containers are not
started by this command.

## Commands

Server runtime commands:

```text
README-SERVER.md
```

Local runtime commands:

```text
README-LOCAL.md
```

## Notes

- `deploy.sh` creates `.env` and `.env.local` from `.env.example` when they are missing
- `deploy.sh` sets `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` only in newly-created `.env.local`
- `deploy.sh` creates external Docker network `edge-net` when it is missing
- `deploy.sh` does not start, stop, restart, or rebuild containers
- `docker-compose.yml` is shared by server and local runtime
- `docker-compose.server.yml` attaches only the frontend to `edge-net`
- `docker-compose.local.yml` publishes the frontend on localhost
