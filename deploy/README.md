# Deploy

Deployment is split into one shared compose file plus one environment-specific override.

## Files
- `docker-compose.yml`: shared base stack.
- `docker-compose.server.yml`: server-only override for `edge-net`.
- `docker-compose.local.yml`: local-only override for host port publishing and local cookie settings.

## Docs
- [README-SERVER.md](README-SERVER.md)
- [README-LOCAL.md](README-LOCAL.md)
